        <p class="milli push-1-2">A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired. The project was part of a school assignment, that involved rebranding a local entrepreneur. With the help of a warm, generous client, a.k.a Scrub Inspired business owner, working on the project was an incredible learning experience.</p><p class="milli push-1-2">Creating complete brand guidelines for the brand, from marketing collateral to digital website. Following thorough research on the brand’s market, it’s target audience, competitors, designing a logo and brand to represent the brand’s values was a thrilling experience (slightly nerve-wracking too! My first time taking on a rebrand).</p><p class="milli push-1-2">The logo for the brand was created to reflect a fun, eco-friendly, fresh experience for its users.</p>

        <p class="milli push-1-2">Following client meetings, initial research on the brand and its competitors was done. To establish a memorable brand, to appeal to its target audience, the logo was an essential component.</p><p class="milli push-1-2">The top half of the logo, the leaf, is reflective of the eco-friendly characteristic of the brand.

        <h3 class="kilo push-1-2">Digital Branding</h3>
        <p class="milli push-1-2">The brand operated purely through online orders(at the time of rebrand, not anymore). To provide a clean and easy shopping experience, a responsive website design was created.
        </p><p class="milli push-1-2">Digital design for facebook, instagram and social media targeting their audience base was designed to provide a wholistic branding experience for the clients and the brand's users.
