          <h3 class="mega push-1-2 gutter-1-2">Research</h3>
          <p class="milli push-1-2 gutter-1-2">Based on a recent study, around 58% of all food produced in canada is either lost or wasted. Around $10 billion worth is lost at the consumer level. Addressing the food wastage at the consumer level, will immensely impact, i.e., reduce carbon-dioxide and methane gas emissions from food landfills created by food waste.</p><p class="milli push-1-2 gutter-1-2">From research, one commonly occuring theme was consumers throwing away cooked and/or uncooked food near expiry date, which could be donated or reused.</p>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-2">
          <h3 class="mega push-1-2 gutter-1-2">Problem Statement</h3>
          <p class="milli push-1-2 gutter-1-2">It is evident that at the consumer level, we as consumers are not conscious about our food wastage and are not aware multiple ways of resuing, sharing and donating food.</p>
          <p class="milli bold push-1-2 gutter-1-2"> Creating a clean, simple and intuitive app for users to minimize & prevent food wastagea and help consumers be conscious of smart food practices.</p>

          <h3 class="mega push-1-2 gutter-1-2">Design Solution</h3>
          <p class="milli push-1-2 gutter-1-2">Food wastage can be minimized and if possible prevented at the root, by planning meal in advance, to avoid ingredient wastage and storage of excess ingredients which may go unused. If there are excess ingredients, sharing and/or donating them to other consumers, would definitely help minimize food wastage. Reusing leftover food will certainly help consumers contribute to a reduced food wastage community.</p>
