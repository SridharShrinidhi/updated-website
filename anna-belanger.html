        <h3 class="kilo push-1-2">Design & Development</h3>
        <p class="milli push-1-2">The website design involved multiple stages of ideating and prototyping, based on client feedback and user needs/goals. Web design prototypes for responsive screens was done using Sketch, which was a great learning experience to learn and work with the Sketch software. The client was already on the Shopify platform, and molding the theme to suit the client's needs was an incredible learning experience. It helped understand the Liquid templating language and provided an opportunity to learn the language. As Shopify themes were geared towards the product industry, modifying it to fit the services industry was an extremely rewarding opportunity.</p>
