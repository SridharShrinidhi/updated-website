            <p class="milli gutter-1-2">The brief for the project was to develop a clean, user friendly website that conveys the brand's message. Warm, accessible environment for clients, was the main goal of the redesign. Bearing in mind their physical spaces in Ottawa, the vibe of the space, representing the same environment on the digital website was of utmost importance. Implementing colors seen in the interior design of the spaces as the accent colours, helped complete and enhance the brand experience.</p>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 gutter-1-2">
          <p class="milli push-1-2 pad-t-1-2">The website design involved multiple stages of ideating and prototyping, based on client feedback and user needs/goals. Making the call-to-action, i.e, Book online accessible was vital as most of the clients preferred booking online and was one of the main reasons for website redesign. Also creating a clean, easy-to-find navigation to understand the different treatments available, benefits, locations was important to promote sales.</p>
          <p class="milli push-0">The client was already on the Shopify platform, and molding the theme to suit the client's needs was an incredible learning experience. It helped understand the Liquid templating language and provided an opportunity to learn the language. As Shopify themes were geared towards the product industry, modifying it to fit the services industry was a challenging but extremely rewarding opportunity.</p>
